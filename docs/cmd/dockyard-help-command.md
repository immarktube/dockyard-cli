# dockyard help Command

The `help` command provides detailed usage information for Dockyard as well as all available subcommands.\
It works similarly to the standard `--help` flag used by most CLI tools.

Use this command whenever you need to explore Dockyard’s capabilities or lookup available options for a specific command.

***

### 📌 **Usage**

#### **General help**

```bash
dockyard help
```

#### **Help for a specific command**

```bash
dockyard help <command>
```

or equivalently:

```bash
dockyard <command> --help
```

***

### 📚 **Examples**

#### **1. Show help for the root Dockyard CLI**

```bash
dockyard help
```

This prints:

* A list of all available commands
* A short description for each
* Basic usage patterns

#### **2. Show help for the `checkout` command**

```bash
dockyard help checkout
```

Equivalent:

```bash
dockyard checkout --help
```

Displays:

* Command usage
* Positional arguments
* Examples
* Detailed explanation of how Dockyard performs batch checkout
* Flags (if any)

***

#### **3. Show help for `exec` command**

```bash
dockyard help exec
```

This provides:

* How to pass arbitrary Git arguments
* Notes for Windows shell quoting
* Examples of common use cases

***

#### **4. Show help for the `updateYaml` command**

```bash
dockyard help updateYaml
```

This prints:

* YAML path format (`a.b.c`)
* Supported behaviors (dry run, auto-create missing nodes, etc.)
* Examples of modifying YAML keys

***

#### **5. List all commands including hidden ones**

Some shells hide commands when using `--help`, but Dockyard’s help always shows everything:

```bash
dockyard help
```

This reveals commands such as:

* `clone`
* `push`
* `sync`
* `exec`
* `run`
* `status`
* `copyFile`
* `patch`
* `createPR`

***

### 🧠 Notes

* Each command in Dockyard automatically supports `--help`.
* `help` is especially useful in CI environments or when scripting Dockyard workflows.
* All help text is generated by Cobra, so it’s consistent and follows standard CLI conventions.

### 🏁 Summary

The `help` command is your primary way to discover:

* What commands exist
* What each command does
* How to use them
* What flags are available
* What arguments they require

It is a core part of the Dockyard experience and essential for navigating the CLI efficiently.
